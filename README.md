# CSProject_PotionCraft
**Project Description:** Potion Craft is an alchemist simulator where you mix ingredients to brew potions. There are several ways you can gather the required ingredients for a potion. You might go out into nature and search for some plants. After searching for some natural ingredients, maybe you will grind ingredients and carefully mix them in your cauldron. Heat the coals. Boil and stir. Add the base: water, oil, or… something else. Part of the fun for this type of game is that you will need to experiment to find new recipes. 

You start the game after you have just opened your new potions shop. Unfortunately, you don’t start with anything so you will have to go out and forage for ingredients. As you start to build a stockpile of ingredients, you can try and make more complex potions. Ultimately, you are trying to build the ultimate shop where someone could buy any natural ingredients, potions, reagents, or legendary products!
